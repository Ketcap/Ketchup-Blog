## Hello {#hello}

Hello everybody. I thought I'll make some blog for myself as everybody does. This blog will be all about my own shitty codes and my thoughts on those things.

<!--more-->

So feel free to think what you want and if it's destructive keep it yourself and if it's building feedback let me know you have my social accounts to reach me. And I'll be putting issues for every post on Github for this repo so we can talk there instead of commenting website.

## Who am i {#who-am-i}

I'm from Turkey and 26(born 1994) year old guy, living in Prague at the moment, and I like Kebap but a proper one and if you give me good breakfast I'll be good all day ðŸ‘Œ.

## My Tech Stack {#tech-stack}

I'm trying to keep up with the most of front-end technologies and back-end technologies in the javascript ecosystem. Currently using:

- Next.js
- React
- React Native
- GraphQL
- Prisma
- Nexus

## Devices {#devices}

The devices I'm using right now is:

- MacBook Pro 2020
- IPad Pro 11'

## Gaming {#gaming}

I was playing games before I moved to Prague but if I decide one day for some shitty reason I'm gonna be building another pc and continue gaming back where I left. Right now you can see my playing:

- Pokemon S&S
